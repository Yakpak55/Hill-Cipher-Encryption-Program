# Hill-Cipher-Encryption-Program
Developed a program to encrypt alphabetic letters in a file using the Hill cipher, capable of handling encryption matrices from 2x2 to 9x9. 

The project involved:

● Command Line Execution: Implemented the program to run from the terminal, accepting command line parameters for the encryption key file and the plaintext file.

● File Handling: Processed input files to extract key matrices and plaintext, converting all alphabetic characters to lowercase and ignoring non-alphabetic characters.

● Matrix Multiplication: Applied matrix multiplication to encrypt the plaintext using the Hill cipher algorithm, ensuring accurate encryption and padding as needed.

● Output Formatting: Generated and displayed the ciphertext in the specified format, with 80 letters per row, ensuring clear and consistent output.
